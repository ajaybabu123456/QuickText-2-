This is a test file to verify the QuickText Pro file upload functionality.

Features to test:
1. File upload (this text file)
2. PDF upload (need to test with a PDF)
3. View count display
4. File download from retrieved content
5. Large file handling (up to 10MB limit)

The file upload system should now support:
- Text files (.txt, .js, .py, .css, etc.)
- PDF files with base64 encoding
- Document files (.doc, .docx, .rtf)
- File size up to 10MB on frontend, 15MB on backend

View counts should increment properly and be displayed in the UI.
Download functionality should work for all file types.
