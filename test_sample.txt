This is a test file to verify the QuickText Pro file upload functionality.

Features to test:
1. File upload (this text file)
2. PDF upload (need to test with a PDF)
3. View count display
4. File download from retrieved content
5. Large file handling (up to 10MB limit)

The file upload system should now support:

- PDF files with base64 encoding
- Document files (.doc, .docx, .rtf)
- File size up to 10MB on frontend, 15MB on backend
